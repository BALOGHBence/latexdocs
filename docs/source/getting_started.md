# Installation

This is optional, but we suggest you to create a dedicated virtual enviroment at all times to avoid conflicts with your other projects. Create a folder, open a command shell in that folder and use the following command

```console
>>> python -m venv venv_name
```

Once the enviroment is created, activate it via typing

```console
>>> .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

latexdocs can be installed (either in a virtual enviroment or globally) from PyPI using pip on Python >= 3.7:

```console
>>> pip install latexdocs
```

## Getting Started with LaTeX

In order to use the library, you'll need a LaTeX compiler. If you are new to LaTeX,
visit the homepage of the project itself [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and/or
check out [this](https://guides.nyu.edu/LaTeX/installation) guide by NYC for an overview of how to get started with LaTeX, as well as resources and exercise to help new users of the program.

You might also need an IDE to edit LaTeX files from time to time, and we suggest you to use [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), which is a free, modern and cross-platform LaTeX editor.
