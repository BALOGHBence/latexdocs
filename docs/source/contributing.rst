Contributing
============

If you want to contribute, there are two approaches, both requireing good working knowledge of LaTeX
and a working distribution. If you are new to LaTeX, follow the instruction at :ref:`Getting Started <getting started>`.

1. (Suggested)  Contribute to PyLaTeX and enjoy the result here (see their docs for further information).
For examples on how to wrap existing functionality in PyLaTeX, take a look at some 
implementations in the :ref:`API Reference <api items>`.

2. Contribute directly to latexdocs. See the implementation of
   the TabularX enviroment in the :ref:`API Reference <api items>`.
